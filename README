This is where I host some of my Lua files for the ComputerCraft Mod for Minecraft.
You can use my GitHub Content Fetcher by running this Command
shell.run("pastebin", "run", "Eky25aPJ", "zachup100", "computercraft", "master", "/")

How the command works
shell.run("pastebin", "run", "Eky25aPJ", "[Author]", "[Repository]", "[Branch]", "[Install Path]")
